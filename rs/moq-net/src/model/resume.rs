//! Splice multiple per-session tracks into one logical track, switching at group
//! boundaries, so a subscription survives route and connection changes.
//!
//! A [`Producer`] holds an ordered list of segments, each a [`track::Consumer`]
//! bounded to a half-open range of group sequences. [`Producer::switch`] appends a
//! segment starting at group `N` and caps the previous one at `N - 1`, so the
//! segments always partition the sequence space. A [`Subscriber`] reads across the
//! segments as if they were one track: bounds are enforced on the read side (a
//! route delivering outside its range is silently filtered), a segment dying
//! stalls the subscriber instead of erroring (the next [`Producer::switch`]
//! resumes it), and demand is forwarded to each underlying track intersected with
//! its segment bounds, so a session serving a segment just sees an ordinary
//! subscription that happens to start or end at a boundary.
