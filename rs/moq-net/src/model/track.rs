//! A track is a collection of semi-reliable and semi-ordered streams, split into a [Producer] and [Subscriber] handle.
//!
//! A [Producer] creates streams with a sequence number and priority.
//! The sequence number is used to determine the order of streams, while the priority is used to determine which stream to transmit first.
//! This may seem counter-intuitive, but is designed for live streaming where the newest streams may be higher priority.
//! A cloned [Producer] can be used to create streams in parallel, but will error if a duplicate sequence number is used.
//!
//! A [Subscriber] may not receive all streams in order or at all.
//! These streams are meant to be transmitted over congested networks and the key to MoQ Transport is to not block on them.
//! Streams will be cached for a potentially limited duration added to the unreliable nature.
//! A [Consumer] is a cheap, cloneable handle; subscribing it multiple times fans the same
//! cached streams out to each independent [Subscriber].
//!
//! The track is closed with [Error] when all writers or readers are dropped.
